## Welcome
You've stumbled across some significant changes to [nplant](http://nplant.org) - none of which are functional in nature.  nplant was origin implemented in it's own standalone project as I was naively anticipating significant contributions from outsiders.  That never happened (and I didn't do much to promote it).  Having it outside of my personal github repository only added friction so I'm moving it there.  

Additionally I'm porting nplant to .NET Core.  I want to get some hands on experience with .NET Core and this should be a very easy baby step as nplant is doing nothing Windows specific.

Lastly, I'm taking this opportunity to set nplant up with VSTS CI.  This is long overdue.  CodeBetter Team City does the job mostly, but I want more and would like to play with VSTS as well.

I said at the beginning there will be no functional changes.  That's a loose statement.  The binary names will likely change, but the functional output of nplant should not.
